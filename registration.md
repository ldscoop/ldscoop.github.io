Note, that this co-op is planned as mini-series and despite the fact
that each part will be pretty much independent, we will relay on assumption,
that our participants are familiar with the content of the previous days.
Therefore, we encourage you to participate in all three meetings.

Most of the exercises you will be able to complete alone, but there are also
(optional) group projects for the participants.

The outline of the series is as follows:
 - The first meeting will cover some introductory topics of data analysis.
 - The second one will be focused on various machine learning methods.
 - During the third meeting we will give you an introduction to more advanced
   topics, such as neural networks or natural language processing.
   Groups that decided to complete our optional assessment will have possibility
   to present their results.
