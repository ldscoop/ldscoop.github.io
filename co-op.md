The workshop will be organized at 24 of August 2018.
<!-- Welcome to the first day of the London Data Science Co-op. -->

## Pre-introduction

From 9 am till 11 am, we plan to have a pre-introduction. If you are new to
Python, we encourage you to take advantage of that opportunity and come early.
It will help you to complete the further parts, that will be much more advanced.

Feel also free to download those notebooks in advance and play with them at
home.

Make also sure, that you have configured environment with Pyhon 3 and Jupyter
Notebook. If it is not the case, we can always help you during the
pre-introduction. But if you do it in advance, then we can save some time and
cover with you some more interesting topics.

### Unit 1: Basic concepts

Please, download
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcinabram/pydata_bootcamp/master/Day1_part1_basic_concepts.ipynb">
the first jupyter notebook</a>.
Look at the example. Try to execute each cell. Take advantage of the fact, that
you can modify all the code. Do it. Play and explore. There would be no
advantage for you if you simply execute all the code without any modifications.
The notebook is intended to be only a starting point. Only breaking the code and
then fixing it again, you will learn how to code yourself. Good luck and have
fun!

### Unit 2: Numpy

If you finish with the first notebook, download
<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/marcinabram/pydata_bootcamp/master/Day1_part2_numpy.ipynb">
the second one</a>.
The structure is similar. Play and explore. And the end of each part you will
also find some exercises. Try to solve them.


## Introduction to Data Science and Data Analysis

Those topics will be covered between 11 am and 4 pm.

### Unit 3: Pandas

The notebook will be provided at the day of the workshop.

### Unit 4: Visualization

The notebook will be provided at the day of the workshop.
