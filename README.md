# London Data Scinece Co-op

Website for the London Data Science Co-op.

We are a community of Data Scientists, Software and Machine Learning Engineers.
Our mission is to share knowledge and help you to become one of us.
There is a beauty in data. There is a satisfaction in uncovering hidden
statistical relationships between seemingly uncorrelated signals.
We want to share our passion with you.

Once in a while we are organizing community bootcamps,
either in form of a single-day even or a mini-series of classes.
Stay tune and hopefully see you soon.
